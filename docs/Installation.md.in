# Installing Lorikeet

## Installation via conda
Lorikeet can be installed through
[Bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/lorikeet-genome). You can use the default conda
if you prefer but we recommend [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) for faster
installation and better error messages.

```
mamba create -c bioconda -c conda-forge --name lorikeet lorikeet-genome'>='[RELEASE_TAG]
```

Test if it works by running
```
conda activate lorikeet
lorikeet -h
```
